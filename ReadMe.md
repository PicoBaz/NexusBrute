# NexusBrute

A sleek, modular brute-force login testing tool built for ethical security audits. NexusBrute empowers developers and security enthusiasts to simulate password attacks on their own systems, highlighting weak credentials and promoting stronger defenses.

## Features
- **Modular Config**: All settings (URL, usernames, password rules) in a single `config.json` file for quick tweaks.
- **Auto CSRF Extraction**: Seamlessly pulls WP Nonce tokens from WooCommerce/WordPress login pages.
- **Smart Password Generation**: Combines common patterns with random strings for realistic testing.
- **Error Resilience**: Automatic retries on transient errors, with configurable delays to avoid locks.
- **CSV Reporting**: Detailed logs of attempts, including timestamps and response codes.
- **Node.js Powered**: Lightweight, no bloat‚Äîruns anywhere with Node.
